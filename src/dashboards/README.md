A Helm chart for custom dashboards

![Version: 0.8.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.8.1-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square) ![AppVersion: 1.0.76620](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-1.0.76620-informational?style=flat-square)

## Usage

Use the following dependency to add this chart repository to your Helm installation:

```
dependencies:
    - name: ng-custom-dashboards
      repository: https://harness.github.io/helm-dashboards
      version: 0.8.1
```

## Required setup
Our Dashboards application uses a 3rd party application called Looker, Looker must have it's own domain name to work.

A DNS CNAME entry must be created for Looker, it is recommended to use `looker.existing-dns-name.tld` as the domain name.

The Looker CNAME should be setup to point at the existing A record for your installation.

## Configuration
To enable dashboards the following is the minimum configuration required.
```yaml
global:
  ngcustomdashboard:
    enabled: true

ng-custom-dashboards:
  config:
    lookerPubDomain: 'looker.domain.tld'

looker:
  secrets:
    lookerLicenseKey: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Airgapped (Offline) install
To install dashboards in an airgapped system an additional offline license key must be provided.
```yaml
looker:
  secrets:
    lookerLicenseKey: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    lookerLicenseFile: |
      xxxxxxx
      yyyyyyy
      zzzzzzz
```

## Configuration Examples
Since Looker must have it's own domain name the ingress/istio configuration is slightly different to other Harness Charts.

The following examples show only the additional config required for this Chart, you will need to merge this with your existing installations values.yaml overrides. Please take special care when merging the `global` sections.

The following examples all have TLS enabled, to ensure your `looker.domain.tld` domain works correctly you should update your TLS certificates to include this domain. Another option is to create a separate certificate and reference that secret below.

### Ingress
```yaml
global:
  ngcustomdashboard:
    enabled: true

ng-custom-dashboards:
  config:
    lookerPubDomain: 'looker.domain.tld'

looker:
  ingress:
    hosts:
      - 'looker.domain.tld'
    tls:
      secretName: 'looker-tls'

  secrets:
    lookerLicenseKey: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Istio
Istio has two potential configuration options
1. Where the Istio gateway is create by the customer.
2. Where the Istio gateway is create by Harness at a global level.
3. Where the Istio gateway is create by this Chart.

#### Istio - gateway created by customer
In this scenario the customer will have to manually update their gateway configuration to route the `looker.domain.tld` domain.
```yaml
global:
  istio:
    virtualService:
      gateways:
      - istio-namespace/gateway-name
  ngcustomdashboard:
    enabled: true

ng-custom-dashboards:
  config:
    lookerPubDomain: 'looker.domain.tld'

looker:
  istio:
    gateway:
      create: false
    virtualService:
      enabled: true
      hosts:
        - looker.domain.tld

  secrets:
    lookerLicenseKey: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

#### Istio - gateway created by Harness
In this case, you can simply add the Looker domain to the list of hosts in your existing `global.istio` configuration.
```yaml
global:
  istio:
    gateway:
      create: true
    hosts:
    - looker.domain.tld
  ngcustomdashboard:
    enabled: true

ng-custom-dashboards:
  config:
    lookerPubDomain: 'looker.domain.tld'

looker:
  istio:
    gateway:
      create: false
    virtualService:
      enabled: true
      hosts:
        - looker.domain.tld

  secrets:
    lookerLicenseKey: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

#### Istio - gateway created by this Chart
In this scenario the gateway configuration is provided here in the values.yaml override.
```yaml
global:
  ngcustomdashboard:
    enabled: true

ng-custom-dashboards:
  config:
    lookerPubDomain: 'looker.domain.tld'

looker:
  istio:
    gateway:
      create: true
      port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
    hosts:
      - looker.domain.tld
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE
      credentialName: 'looker-tls'
    virtualService:
      enabled: true
      hosts:
        - looker.domain.tld

  secrets:
    lookerLicenseKey: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
